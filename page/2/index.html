<p>I used to be a bookworm with poor communication skills. However,in 2021, I was recommended to join an English-speaking competition with two students from our district. As the eldest among the three students, I took my responsibilities as a leader reluctantly. </p>
<p>My first concern was writing a script online, for we may not be on the same page with each other due to Internet gap. As a result, I became the leader of our discussion. Considering the time limit and our capacity and having studied lots of short novels, we based our script on The Last Leave written by O. Henry. I suggested that each of us write a script and exchange advice three days later. Our script came out successfully.</p>
<p>The second obstacle we faced were clothes. Wearing uniforms all day, we had no idea of fashion in another period. I studied the illustrations in the book and the articles written during the same period in American for the description of the clothes. At the same time, she read the novel concentrating on the characters’ personalities. Then we searched the Internet for clothes that fit the characters’ personalities and the trend of that era.</p>
<p>After finding proper clothes, our greatest crisis came-rehearsing. From different schools, we hardly had any time to gather. As a result, I suggested rehearsing online until being familiar with our lines, then I would contact their school and took off for a few afternoons to focus on acting skills. When we acted on the stage our acting turned out to be faint without power-point and background music. But we all had no computer skills and only had two weeks left so I asked my roommate for help, offering to help her with Chinese to prepare for the coming exam. She agreed.</p>
<p>Finally, we received first price. Thanks to that experience, I entered Nanjing Foreign Language School and became the vice president of Oral History Club one year later. Now I am not afraid of leading anymore. Success is not vital; failure is not fatal. It’s the courage to change that counts.</p>

        <p><em>Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome? (Maximum 350 words)</em></p>
<p>Oral history is a rounded way to explore events in the past mainly through interviewing people who experienced that specific historical period.</p>
<p>I chose it as my selective course, being attracted by its form interviewing as well as its firm connection with sociology. After a lecture and theoretical classes, I started my first interview </p>
<p>Before the interview, I prepared a lot, including finishing reading the interviewee’s articles on the Internet, making mind maps about his experiences, sending a question list to him. </p>
<p>However, the interview didn’t reach my imagination that everything was well planned, for we turned out to be passive. I was confused after the interview about what oral history should be, for a long time I consider it as something about me—what I wanted to know and express to my readers and audience. My idea was greatly challenged.</p>
<p>Therefore, for weeks I have been trying to find the answer. Consequently, I found the answer from the lecture given by Doctor You from Nanjing University. </p>
<p>She mentioned that oral history differs from other ways of researching for it tended to be about stories, emotions instead of statistics and simple answers. Though it is relatively informal, we hear different voices from people who won’t be remembered by history but make up a crucial part of it. What we are supposed to be is not a leader but an archaeologist who seek for people’s thoughts.</p>
<p>After simple reflection, I come up with ways to improve. First, prepare creatively, like preparing questions from more aspects, which allows us to be more flexible while interviewing. Besides, train our language skills, be more active and never influence what the interviewee’s ideas with our thoughts, for every single opinion shows how people think during a specific time and makes sociology studies more typical by including opinions from people from different backgrounds. What’s more, our thoughts should get deep into social phenomenon based on fact.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my opinions about oral history may not be mutual enough, but by putting ideas into practice and reflecting can I get closer the truth of history.</p>
