<li>比较冷门，很多同学会被采访、成文稿、逐字稿给劝退</li>
<li>做一个项目需要很长时间（而且很多时候都只能cover到一个主题的一小部分）</li>
<li>做一个项目需要大量的人手，这学期我们基本没有历史课，所以失去历史老师的帮助，不会有那么多人参加</li>
<li>限制比较的多： 访谈对象，访谈地点，访谈时长……</li>
<li>由于单次访谈对所人手、设备、时长的要求比较多，基本就只能采访到在南外的师生。但是仅限于南外的历史的话主题就不够多元，而且历史价值也比较单一</li>
<li>口述历史只是历史研究方法的一部分，我不太希望只局限于一种研究方法或是了解历史的途径</li>

        <p>Since my early chilldhood, I have been aware of my seemingly magical ability to make reasonable assumptions for the causes of people’s behaviours and even predict something in the future. I was able to discover the truth of why my junior high maths teacher resigned, whether my father treats my cat carefully or not and who will forget to bring our script while rehaersing and act accordingly. However,when I first really realized my ability, I thought it was nothing but my crazy childish imagination.</p>
<p>However, one day, while watching the BBC Sherlock series, I was illuminated by his description of “the science of conduction”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put simply,he described his deduction process as finding evidence(no matter it’s a trifle or not), trying to find out the links between the details and finding the explannation that best suits the evidence. I began to realize that most of my assumptions are not crazy imagination, but something based on my observations unintentionally. I analyze people’s choice of words, their changes in voice, their facial expressions, their clothes and so on to find out the truth. A simple exampe was that once I was sitting with a stranger in a noodle restaurant. While chatting, I asked her whether she was a colledge student with a cat. She was surprised. In fact,it was not hard to deduce for there are scratches on the back of her phone. Most of her nails were long while only nails of two fingers which we used to write were cut so she must arite a lot. From her hair clip and her make-up, we can deduce that she was young but was not a high school student. The poems inscribed on the back of her phone indicates that she enjoyed high level of education. To put all these clues together, she is a colledge student for sure.</p>
<p>My belief was shaking again when I tried to write my latest discovery in my document. One scene in the TV series just occured to me again. I remember that Sherlock once infrred that the victim was in the social media industry simply because she wore a light pink coat. It seemed to be irrational. What if she was only a person who loved wearing fashionable clothes?Then, I went back to the novel and found the quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Winwood_Reade">Winwood Reade</a> is good upon the subject,” said Holmes. “He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We balance probabilities and choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put these in a simple way, Sherlock did not deduce what job the victim did but what job the victim probably did. Then he used other clues to examine the solidarity of this statement. The more the clues, the more he approached the most possible image of the victim. That’s like a hypothesis test.</p>
<p>I found this statement quite impressive and one day while reading a book called<em>An Invitation to Sociology</em>, I found sociological explanations for my previous two believes–social control theory and social stratification.Social control theory demonstrates how the society controls us through political system,law,moral,customs and so on.These mean that our wearings, language, taste, political and religious delief are all methods for the society to control us and influence what we are supposed to do in certain circumstances. Social stratification assumes people are categorized in to various layers by various standards in the society. On one hand, people use different symbols(items,languages,taste) to demonstrate the status they have reached unintentionally. This is called status symbolism. On the other hand the layer that we are in bring us with some probabilities and opportunities(like how hard it is for your child to receive high level of education). As a result,we are connected to these details due to the control of society and the act of ourselves. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that such theory does not deny the existence of some exceptions but even if we do not obey the tangible and intangible social rules, the society has planned our paths just like you commit crimes you will be sent to prison. So, you can imagine the society as a tree diagram with many branches. Each branch has a certain possibility ceteris paribus. The more we know about the decisions someone has already made, the more we can infer about the decisions that they are going to make. But after all, what we are dealing with probabilities because we can never know every detail about a human being. Sometimes events with a really low probability can occur. We are supposed to stay open to the facts and base our theories on concrete evidence.</p>
<p>That’s the whole process of how my belief was shaken again and again. I find this process of correcting and improving my previous belief quite interesting. I still stay open about this opinion and perhaps my belief will shake again in the future,just like how Sherlock put it:”It’s a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgement.”</p>

        <p>Drama is something that is always fascinating to me and has changed my life path greatly. In this article, I will write about some of my most unforgettable drama experiences and the life-long lessons I have learnt while rehearsing.</p>
<h2 id="Primary-school–dawn-of-a-beautiful-dream"><a href="#Primary-school–dawn-of-a-beautiful-dream" class="headerlink" title="Primary school–dawn of a beautiful dream"></a>Primary school–dawn of a beautiful dream</h2><p>My primary school English teacher,Ms.Chen, unlike many teachrs who were always pressing their students into endless exercises, encouraged us to fing our interests through short plays. I had the opportunity to act as the fairy in <em>Cinderella</em>, the cheater in <em>The King’s New Clothes</em> as well as the first brother in <em>The Tale of The Three Brothers</em> . Though our script was quite childish, so was our acting skills, the days spent creating scripts and rehearsing with my friends became my initial inspiration of English learning and also the dawn of my gorgeous drama dream.</p>

It was the first chance for my to participate in a formal  occasion so I watched the film for several times and tried my best to be resonate with Maria. She was someone who had a vigor for adventure and was kind and brave. However, as a young lady, she was sometims confused by the future. When I was singing,I felt the emotions floating with the melody and fairly enjoyed this experience. Also,during the proccess, I gradually learnt to analyse the character.</p>

<h3 id="The-Last-Leave"><a href="#The-Last-Leave" class="headerlink" title="The Last Leave"></a><em>The Last Leave</em></h3><p>When I was in junior high, I became keen on learning English. After participating in several English competitions and accumulating the experience of public speaking, I was recommended to join an English speaking competition in the 9th grade, representing  Jiangbei New Area. In the first section of  the competition I was supposed to put on a play with two 8th graders from our region.</p>
<p>This proccess was so unique and memorable not only because the outbreak of the virus forced us to meet online for most time, but also because I was able to be the script writer as well as the actress of Sue in our play. During this process, I studied the original novel written by O. Henry from aspects like the social background, the personalities of characters, the theme, the clothes of that era. Since we had to finish all the things by ourselves, we  learnt a lot about background design and how to add proper music at proper time. I even chose the costume myself. </p>
<p>What was special about this drama was that I learnt to be a leader of a team during the same time. Comunicating with my teammates Wang and Jin as well as their parents and teachers made me more experienced and contributed to my confidence greatly. Also, while rehearsing I lernt a lot about acting from Wang, who was a great actress.</p>
<p>All of these things made a big difference to my acting skills. When I was finally on stage, sorrow,hope and the feeling of struggling just flowed into my heart, natural and real, like a river. It was the first time I felt as if I was the character herself.<img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片1.png" alt="图片1"><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片2.png" alt="图片2"><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片3.png" alt="图片3"></p>

It turned out to be the best choice I have ever made. Our drama class was amazing.</p>
<p>The first play we put on was Macbeth. In this play I acted as one of the witches. This task was quite challenging as well as rewarding. The witch was quite complicated to me. She was controlling everything from the beginning to the end and watched  and pushed Macbeth toward his tragic fate. However, what attracted me was what kind of feelings she had while she was driving Macbeth to commit one crime and another. Was she an indifferent bystander? Was she an active watcher ? Was she just a spokeswoman of fate? These questions were confusing so I asked my teacher for help. She told me that something great about drama was that you could always act the character in the way you understand and there was just no easy answer.</p>
<p>So in my version of the witch, she was just a spokeswoman of fate. She did not mean to be evil and did not enjoy the proccess of bringing Macbeth to the darkness but she was unable to change people’s destiny. Most people thought it was the witch that turned Macbeth a tragedy but from my point of view, it’s lady Macbeth and Macbeth himself  as well as the people around them that made his fate unavoidable. The witch was only a medium of indicating the darkness of humanity to th audience. This experience was quite interesting for it reminded me that characters could be complicated and we should spare no effort to find the cause of their actions.<img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\Screenshot_2023-04-30-22-31-54-734-edit_com.tence.jpg" alt="Screenshot_2023-04-30-22-31-54-734-edit_com.tence"></p>

<p>When I was in junior high, I used to be afraid of singing in public. When I was singing for Fantine, however, my classmates kept encouraging me and gradually when I was singing what I felt was no longer embarrasement but the love  pain as well as a sense of helpless and hopeless of Fantine. While singing the esemble with my classmate, I taught her how to sing bel canto, the moment she improved her voice, I was more than happy.</p>
<p>While acting, I felt the passion of our class was in the air. Though we missed the first place because the category of our play was controversial, all the students and teachers were greatly shocked by our play. One of my classmate put our video online and it received over2000 views.</p>

<h3 id="The-Glass-Menagerie"><a href="#The-Glass-Menagerie" class="headerlink" title="The Glass Menagerie"></a>The Glass Menagerie</h3><p>It was a recent play our drama class is focusing on.</p>
<p>I played Laura and gradually found the masterpiece fascinating to me. Unlike the plays above, I was in awe of the use of poetic realism in this script. The music,the background,the plot…everything are arranged in such a transparent and splendid order to emphasis the tragedy of the gorgeous unrealistic world in which the Wingfields live.</p>
<p>Still I have substaintial questions to ask. I am curious whether Laura will be brave again(I hope but the possibility is low)I am curios whether the family will reunion eventually.When Laura passes the broken unicorn to Jim, does that suggests that she is greatly harmed or the knot in her heart is finnaly solved and she can live normally again?</p>

<p>I am still working on these problems and may have far to go. But what makes drama so attractive is that it’s like an  immense ocean and I still have a lot to discover.</p>
