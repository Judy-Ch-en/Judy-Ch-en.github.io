<li>比较冷门，很多同学会被采访、成文稿、逐字稿给劝退</li>
<li>做一个项目需要很长时间（而且很多时候都只能cover到一个主题的一小部分）</li>
<li>做一个项目需要大量的人手，这学期我们基本没有历史课，所以失去历史老师的帮助，不会有那么多人参加</li>
<li>限制比较的多： 访谈对象，访谈地点，访谈时长……</li>
<li>由于单次访谈对所人手、设备、时长的要求比较多，基本就只能采访到在南外的师生。但是仅限于南外的历史的话主题就不够多元，而且历史价值也比较单一</li>
<li>口述历史只是历史研究方法的一部分，我不太希望只局限于一种研究方法或是了解历史的途径</li>

        <p>Since my early chilldhood, I have been aware of my seemingly magical ability to make reasonable assumptions for the causes of people’s behaviours and even predict something in the future. I was able to discover the truth of why my junior high maths teacher resigned, whether my father treats my cat carefully or not and who will forget to bring our script while rehaersing and act accordingly. However,when I first really realized my ability, I thought it was nothing but my crazy childish imagination.</p>
<p>However, one day, while watching the BBC Sherlock series, I was illuminated by his description of “the science of conduction”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both before and after.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put simply,he described his deduction process as finding evidence(no matter it’s a trifle or not), trying to find out the links between the details and finding the explannation that best suits the evidence. I began to realize that most of my assumptions are not crazy imagination, but something based on my observations unintentionally. I analyze people’s choice of words, their changes in voice, their facial expressions, their clothes and so on to find out the truth. A simple exampe was that once I was sitting with a stranger in a noodle restaurant. While chatting, I asked her whether she was a colledge student with a cat. She was surprised. In fact,it was not hard to deduce for there are scratches on the back of her phone. Most of her nails were long while only nails of two fingers which we used to write were cut so she must arite a lot. From her hair clip and her make-up, we can deduce that she was young but was not a high school student. The poems inscribed on the back of her phone indicates that she enjoyed high level of education. To put all these clues together, she is a colledge student for sure.</p>
<p>My belief was shaking again when I tried to write my latest discovery in my document. One scene in the TV series just occured to me again. I remember that Sherlock once infrred that the victim was in the social media industry simply because she wore a light pink coat. It seemed to be irrational. What if she was only a person who loved wearing fashionable clothes?Then, I went back to the novel and found the quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Winwood_Reade">Winwood Reade</a> is good upon the subject,” said Holmes. “He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We balance probabilities and choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put these in a simple way, Sherlock did not deduce what job the victim did but what job the victim probably did. Then he used other clues to examine the solidarity of this statement. The more the clues, the more he approached the most possible image of the victim. That’s like a hypothesis test.</p>
<p>I found this statement quite impressive and one day while reading a book called<em>An Invitation to Sociology</em>, I found sociological explanations for my previous two believes–social control theory and social stratification.Social control theory demonstrates how the society controls us through political system,law,moral,customs and so on.These mean that our wearings, language, taste, political and religious delief are all methods for the society to control us and influence what we are supposed to do in certain circumstances. Social stratification assumes people are categorized in to various layers by various standards in the society. On one hand, people use different symbols(items,languages,taste) to demonstrate the status they have reached unintentionally. This is called status symbolism. On the other hand the layer that we are in bring us with some probabilities and opportunities(like how hard it is for your child to receive high level of education). As a result,we are connected to these details due to the control of society and the act of ourselves. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that such theory does not deny the existence of some exceptions but even if we do not obey the tangible and intangible social rules, the society has planned our paths just like you commit crimes you will be sent to prison. So, you can imagine the society as a tree diagram with many branches. Each branch has a certain possibility ceteris paribus. The more we know about the decisions someone has already made, the more we can infer about the decisions that they are going to make. But after all, what we are dealing with probabilities because we can never know every detail about a human being. Sometimes events with a really low probability can occur. We are supposed to stay open to the facts and base our theories on concrete evidence.</p>
<p>That’s the whole process of how my belief was shaken again and again. I find this process of correcting and improving my previous belief quite interesting. I still stay open about this opinion and perhaps my belief will shake again in the future,just like how Sherlock put it:”It’s a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgement.”</p>

        <p><em>What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time? (Maximum 350 words)</em></p>
<p>Being a fan of detective stories and TV series,my passion to speculate the murderer never dies. I rarely fail to find out the killer before Mr. Poirot. Then I gradually noticed myself easily telling who was lying while playing with my classmates, predicting what had happened to a person based on their expressions, predicting my teachers’ choice of words in class and even predicting the content of examinations. This reveals my talent of using logic and evidence to analyze and predict people’s behavior.</p>
<p>I started to wonder why I could predict the future and got the following reasons. First, learning vocal music for over 8 years and being good at public speaking make me more sensitive to the sudden change in people’s voice and their facial expressions. When they try to lie, they would be nervous or pretend to be casual. In any case, their tone and facial expressions would be slightly different. This makes it easier for me detect the truth concealed. Besides, as a bookworm, I noticed that most people would use the same pattern of words in similar occasions. As a result, when their language pattern appears unusual, we can get a picture of what have happened to them by analyzing the words they used. These two reasons above enable me to analyze people’s behavior. Last but not least, to predict their behavior precisely, we ought to connect their behavior with objective existence. By putting all these clues together, we can get their thinking patterns.</p>
<p>To fully realize my talent, I play detective games, putting all the clues together and analyze the most possible answer. I also read some sociological books to connect a person’s behavior with the society in which they live. I realize this talent is really helpful for when I was required to make a  group presentation . I successfully predicted two of my group mates would not bring their copies by their daily behaviors and the messages they sent in our working group. This eventually saved our presentation.</p>

<p>Take our English oral test as an example. We are divided into groups, write scripts for different topics and give presentations every term..Nevertheless,I find most students’ scripts are distinctly formal,full of abstract sermon.Therefore I decided to change.</p>
<p>The first attempt was made when I was in charge of the topic ‘friendship’ in 2022. The story of girls breaking up and forgiving each other seemed so familiar to everyone.However, it is not realistic in teenagers’ life. Instead,I wrote about social phobia.As Christmas was approaching, I added  Christmas elements.My story was about two girls living in the same building. They never really talked to each other though for they were too shy.Santa Claus mistakenly delivered the two girls’ gifts on Christmas eve.By exchanging their gifts they found themselves sharing similar interest and eventually became friends.I add lots of motions to show the plot better.But this brought me troubles, for there wasn’t enough space for us to move while presenting.But this taught me if you wanted to be creative, have a clear version of the situation first.</p>
<p>Therefore came my second attempt.In 2023, I was responsible for the abstract topic ‘virtue’. Most of my classmates chose to debate. Instead,my script was about how a group of teenagers found out the meaning of virtue while preparing for a campaign about virtue reluctantly, obliged by their teacher. During their preparation, they found new perspectives to understand virtue: through  literature, they could know the change of the content of virtue;through oral history interviews, they realized how acts of kindness can influence students graduated from their school; through cooperating, they had developed a deep relationship.Virtue was never far away, it was something specific.I separated the script into different scenes in order to avoid too many motions on the stage and focused on body language. It was successful.</p>
<p>The process of being creative is full of twists and turns but it’s worthwhile, for what pushes the world forward is always creativity.</p>

<p> I used to be a so-called social phobia in primary school. Whenever I was making a presentation in public, I felt deadly nervous. However, my attitude towards public speaking completely changed in 8th grade.</p>
<p>  In May,2021, I was instructed by my English teacher to join in an English speaking competition in Jiangsu province. I felt as if stress was in the air. Fearing that I might let my teacher down, I practiced hard with two other students.</p>
<p>  In the beginning, things were in a complete mass. I didn’t know what to say and how to organize my opinions. Improving the quantity of my public speaking experience was in real earnest. My roommates heard about my problems and offered film my trials. With the assistance of her and the reflections on myself, my speaking standard improved.</p>
<p>  Then, the main target was to increase the quality of my ideas and speech. During this period, I came across different topics and had mind storms with my teammates about how to acquire arguments from various perspectives as well as how to use our arguments to support our opinions. In this way our ability to give response to an unfamiliar topic in a short time interval grew.  I also encouraged my teammate to express her ideas and take on the courage to speak.</p>
<p>  Finally, it was time for presentation. On the stage, holding the microphone in hand, the nerve and stress that had been familiar to me no longer got in the way. The only thing I felt was the excitement of delivering my thoughts to others and the confidence of myself. At last, I got the first prize in the competition. The skills I gained while improving my public speaking standard provided me with a concrete foundation in my later life.</p>
<p>  Without this event, I would perhaps never discover my talent in public speaking and would not then enter Nanjing Foreign Language School. Also, without the event I would never know that only with efforts to step outside of my comfort zone, can I realize my inner potential.</p>

        <p>Drama is something that is always fascinating to me and has changed my life path greatly. In this article, I will write about some of my most unforgettable drama experiences and the life-long lessons I have learnt while rehearsing.</p>
<h2 id="Primary-school–dawn-of-a-beautiful-dream"><a href="#Primary-school–dawn-of-a-beautiful-dream" class="headerlink" title="Primary school–dawn of a beautiful dream"></a>Primary school–dawn of a beautiful dream</h2><p>My primary school English teacher,Ms.Chen, unlike many teachrs who were always pressing their students into endless exercises, encouraged us to fing our interests through short plays. I had the opportunity to act as the fairy in <em>Cinderella</em>, the cheater in <em>The King’s New Clothes</em> as well as the first brother in <em>The Tale of The Three Brothers</em> . Though our script was quite childish, so was our acting skills, the days spent creating scripts and rehearsing with my friends became my initial inspiration of English learning and also the dawn of my gorgeous drama dream.</p>

It was the first chance for my to participate in a formal  occasion so I watched the film for several times and tried my best to be resonate with Maria. She was someone who had a vigor for adventure and was kind and brave. However, as a young lady, she was sometims confused by the future. When I was singing,I felt the emotions floating with the melody and fairly enjoyed this experience. Also,during the proccess, I gradually learnt to analyse the character.</p>

<h3 id="The-Last-Leave"><a href="#The-Last-Leave" class="headerlink" title="The Last Leave"></a><em>The Last Leave</em></h3><p>When I was in junior high, I became keen on learning English. After participating in several English competitions and accumulating the experience of public speaking, I was recommended to join an English speaking competition in the 9th grade, representing  Jiangbei New Area. In the first section of  the competition I was supposed to put on a play with two 8th graders from our region.</p>
<p>This proccess was so unique and memorable not only because the outbreak of the virus forced us to meet online for most time, but also because I was able to be the script writer as well as the actress of Sue in our play. During this process, I studied the original novel written by O. Henry from aspects like the social background, the personalities of characters, the theme, the clothes of that era. Since we had to finish all the things by ourselves, we  learnt a lot about background design and how to add proper music at proper time. I even chose the costume myself. </p>
<p>What was special about this drama was that I learnt to be a leader of a team during the same time. Comunicating with my teammates Wang and Jin as well as their parents and teachers made me more experienced and contributed to my confidence greatly. Also, while rehearsing I lernt a lot about acting from Wang, who was a great actress.</p>
<p>All of these things made a big difference to my acting skills. When I was finally on stage, sorrow,hope and the feeling of struggling just flowed into my heart, natural and real, like a river. It was the first time I felt as if I was the character herself.<img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片1.png" alt="图片1"><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片2.png" alt="图片2"><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片3.png" alt="图片3"></p>

<h2 id="Senior-high–-dicovering-the-immense-ocean"><a href="#Senior-high–-dicovering-the-immense-ocean" class="headerlink" title="Senior high– dicovering the immense ocean"></a>Senior high– dicovering the immense ocean</h2><h3 id="Macbeth"><a href="#Macbeth" class="headerlink" title="Macbeth"></a>Macbeth</h3><p>When I entered Nanjing Foreign Language school, I chose drama as my selective course. It turned out to be the best choice I have ever made. Our drama class was amazing.</p>
<p>The first play we put on was Macbeth. In this play I acted as one of the witches. This task was quite challenging as well as rewarding. The witch was quite complicated to me. She was controlling everything from the beginning to the end and watched  and pushed Macbeth toward his tragic fate. However, what attracted me was what kind of feelings she had while she was driving Macbeth to commit one crime and another. Was she an indifferent bystander? Was she an active watcher ? Was she just a spokeswoman of fate? These questions were confusing so I asked my teacher for help. She told me that something great about drama was that you could always act the character in the way you understand and there was just no easy answer.</p>
<p>So in my version of the witch, she was just a spokeswoman of fate. She did not mean to be evil and did not enjoy the proccess of bringing Macbeth to the darkness but she was unable to change people’s destiny. Most people thought it was the witch that turned Macbeth a tragedy but from my point of view, it’s lady Macbeth and Macbeth himself  as well as the people around them that made his fate unavoidable. The witch was only a medium of indicating the darkness of humanity to th audience. This experience was quite interesting for it reminded me that characters could be complicated and we should spare no effort to find the cause of their actions.<img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\Screenshot_2023-04-30-22-31-54-734-edit_com.tence.jpg" alt="Screenshot_2023-04-30-22-31-54-734-edit_com.tence"></p>

<h3 id="dubbing-Fantine-in-Les-Misrables"><a href="#dubbing-Fantine-in-Les-Misrables" class="headerlink" title="dubbing Fantine in Les Misrables"></a>dubbing Fantine in Les Misrables</h3><p>Our class put on this play on the foreign language festival.Compared with other experiences, this experience was very warm and meaningful.</p>
<p>When I was in junior high, I used to be afraid of singing in public. When I was singing for Fantine, however, my classmates kept encouraging me and gradually when I was singing what I felt was no longer embarrasement but the love  pain as well as a sense of helpless and hopeless of Fantine. While singing the esemble with my classmate, I taught her how to sing bel canto, the moment she improved her voice, I was more than happy.</p>
<p>While acting, I felt the passion of our class was in the air. Though we missed the first place because the category of our play was controversial, all the students and teachers were greatly shocked by our play. One of my classmate put our video online and it received over2000 views.</p>
<p><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材-6e4b9ee780633014.jpg" alt="-6e4b9ee780633014"></p>
<h3 id="The-Glass-Menagerie"><a href="#The-Glass-Menagerie" class="headerlink" title="The Glass Menagerie"></a>The Glass Menagerie</h3><p>It was a recent play our drama class is focusing on.</p>
<p>I played Laura and gradually found the masterpiece fascinating to me. Unlike the plays above, I was in awe of the use of poetic realism in this script. The music,the background,the plot…everything are arranged in such a transparent and splendid order to emphasis the tragedy of the gorgeous unrealistic world in which the Wingfields live.</p>
<p>Still I have substaintial questions to ask. I am curious whether Laura will be brave again(I hope but the possibility is low)I am curios whether the family will reunion eventually.When Laura passes the broken unicorn to Jim, does that suggests that she is greatly harmed or the knot in her heart is finnaly solved and she can live normally again?</p>

<p>(Laura in <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>)</p>
<p>I am still working on these problems and may have far to go. But what makes drama so attractive is that it’s like an  immense ocean and I still have a lot to discover.</p>

<p>When I witnessed some Nanjing Foreign Language school students rehearsing The Sound of Music in 9th grade, I was completely in awe. The enchantment of musical became my initial inspiration of the goal that perhaps someday, I would join them, expressing myself confidently on the stage. This goal, however, seemed to be too far and too faint for me since my English was not outstanding then.</p>
<p>As someone puts it :dream is like a lighthouse which directs you on your journey, I began to split my goal into small charts step by step. For the first few months, I mainly concentrated on memorizing the words and passages. Lots of efforts were paid, but the output was wretched. A sense of confusion had caught me. </p>
<p>As a result, I went to my teacher for help. She suggested that simple memorization was not reliable from the long term, I had better try to improve my memorizing skills and study English from more aspects. So I read books like Buzan’s Study Skills to memorize things quickly. Also, I brought English and literature into my life. While watching an English TV series, I would imitate the characters’ tone. While others were reading the Chinese version of a book, I would try to read the originate one, even it’s hard for me to understand. Days after days, my English ability accumulated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the vocabulary and grammar problems had been generally solved, another problem exposed-I was not capable of speaking logically in front of others. I bought an oral English book and practiced 3 to 5 topics over and over every day. My roommates joined me later and we took videos and gave comments to each other. After weeks of practicing, I took part in the additional entrance exam of Nanjing Foreign Language School.</p>
<p>When I am writing my story, one year has already passed. But whenever I look back to my road full of struggling, I get a feeling that all my efforts pay off.</p>

<p>I used to be a bookworm with poor communication skills. However,in 2021, I was recommended to join an English-speaking competition with two students from our district. As the eldest among the three students, I took my responsibilities as a leader reluctantly. </p>
<p>My first concern was writing a script online, for we may not be on the same page with each other due to Internet gap. As a result, I became the leader of our discussion. Considering the time limit and our capacity and having studied lots of short novels, we based our script on The Last Leave written by O. Henry. I suggested that each of us write a script and exchange advice three days later. Our script came out successfully.</p>
<p>The second obstacle we faced were clothes. Wearing uniforms all day, we had no idea of fashion in another period. I studied the illustrations in the book and the articles written during the same period in American for the description of the clothes. At the same time, she read the novel concentrating on the characters’ personalities. Then we searched the Internet for clothes that fit the characters’ personalities and the trend of that era.</p>
<p>After finding proper clothes, our greatest crisis came-rehearsing. From different schools, we hardly had any time to gather. As a result, I suggested rehearsing online until being familiar with our lines, then I would contact their school and took off for a few afternoons to focus on acting skills. When we acted on the stage our acting turned out to be faint without power-point and background music. But we all had no computer skills and only had two weeks left so I asked my roommate for help, offering to help her with Chinese to prepare for the coming exam. She agreed.</p>
<p>Finally, we received first price. Thanks to that experience, I entered Nanjing Foreign Language School and became the vice president of Oral History Club one year later. Now I am not afraid of leading anymore. Success is not vital; failure is not fatal. It’s the courage to change that counts.</p>

        <p><em>Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome? (Maximum 350 words)</em></p>
<p>Oral history is a rounded way to explore events in the past mainly through interviewing people who experienced that specific historical period.</p>
<p>I chose it as my selective course, being attracted by its form interviewing as well as its firm connection with sociology. After a lecture and theoretical classes, I started my first interview </p>
<p>Before the interview, I prepared a lot, including finishing reading the interviewee’s articles on the Internet, making mind maps about his experiences, sending a question list to him. </p>
<p>However, the interview didn’t reach my imagination that everything was well planned, for we turned out to be passive. I was confused after the interview about what oral history should be, for a long time I consider it as something about me—what I wanted to know and express to my readers and audience. My idea was greatly challenged.</p>
<p>Therefore, for weeks I have been trying to find the answer. Consequently, I found the answer from the lecture given by Doctor You from Nanjing University. </p>
<p>She mentioned that oral history differs from other ways of researching for it tended to be about stories, emotions instead of statistics and simple answers. Though it is relatively informal, we hear different voices from people who won’t be remembered by history but make up a crucial part of it. What we are supposed to be is not a leader but an archaeologist who seek for people’s thoughts.</p>
<p>After simple reflection, I come up with ways to improve. First, prepare creatively, like preparing questions from more aspects, which allows us to be more flexible while interviewing. Besides, train our language skills, be more active and never influence what the interviewee’s ideas with our thoughts, for every single opinion shows how people think during a specific time and makes sociology studies more typical by including opinions from people from different backgrounds. What’s more, our thoughts should get deep into social phenomenon based on fact.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my opinions about oral history may not be mutual enough, but by putting ideas into practice and reflecting can I get closer the truth of history.</p>
