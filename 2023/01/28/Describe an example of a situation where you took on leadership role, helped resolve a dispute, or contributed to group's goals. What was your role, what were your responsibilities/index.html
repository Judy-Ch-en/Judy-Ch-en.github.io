<p>I used to be a bookworm with poor communication skills. However,in 2021, I was recommended to join an English-speaking competition with two students from our district. As the eldest among the three students, I took my responsibilities as a leader reluctantly. </p>
<p>My first concern was writing a script online, for we may not be on the same page with each other due to Internet gap. As a result, I became the leader of our discussion. Considering the time limit and our capacity and having studied lots of short novels, we based our script on The Last Leave written by O. Henry. I suggested that each of us write a script and exchange advice three days later. Our script came out successfully.</p>
<p>The second obstacle we faced were clothes. Wearing uniforms all day, we had no idea of fashion in another period. I studied the illustrations in the book and the articles written during the same period in American for the description of the clothes. At the same time, she read the novel concentrating on the characters’ personalities. Then we searched the Internet for clothes that fit the characters’ personalities and the trend of that era.</p>
<p>After finding proper clothes, our greatest crisis came-rehearsing. From different schools, we hardly had any time to gather. As a result, I suggested rehearsing online until being familiar with our lines, then I would contact their school and took off for a few afternoons to focus on acting skills. When we acted on the stage our acting turned out to be faint without power-point and background music. But we all had no computer skills and only had two weeks left so I asked my roommate for help, offering to help her with Chinese to prepare for the coming exam. She agreed.</p>
<p>Finally, we received first price. Thanks to that experience, I entered Nanjing Foreign Language School and became the vice president of Oral History Club one year later. Now I am not afraid of leading anymore. Success is not vital; failure is not fatal. It’s the courage to change that counts.</p>
