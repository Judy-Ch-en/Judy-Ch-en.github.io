        <p>Drama is something that is always fascinating to me and has changed my life path greatly. In this article, I will write about some of my most unforgettable drama experiences and the life-long lessons I have learnt while rehearsing.</p>
<h2 id="Primary-school–dawn-of-a-beautiful-dream"><a href="#Primary-school–dawn-of-a-beautiful-dream" class="headerlink" title="Primary school–dawn of a beautiful dream"></a>Primary school–dawn of a beautiful dream</h2><p>My primary school English teacher,Ms.Chen, unlike many teachrs who were always pressing their students into endless exercises, encouraged us to fing our interests through short plays. I had the opportunity to act as the fairy in <em>Cinderella</em>, the cheater in <em>The King’s New Clothes</em> as well as the first brother in <em>The Tale of The Three Brothers</em> . Though our script was quite childish, so was our acting skills, the days spent creating scripts and rehearsing with my friends became my initial inspiration of English learning and also the dawn of my gorgeous drama dream.</p>

<h2 id="Junior-high–preparing-for-blossoming"><a href="#Junior-high–preparing-for-blossoming" class="headerlink" title="Junior high–preparing for blossoming"></a>Junior high–preparing for blossoming</h2><h3 id="dubbing-in-The-Sound-of-Music"><a href="#dubbing-in-The-Sound-of-Music" class="headerlink" title="dubbing in The Sound of Music"></a>dubbing in <em>The Sound of Music</em></h3><p>Being recommanded to a group of teenagers from a foreign language school by my vocal music teacher, I accidentally got the opportunity to be the voice actor of Maria in <em>The Sound of Music</em>. It was the first chance for my to participate in a formal  occasion so I watched the film for several times and tried my best to be resonate with Maria. She was someone who had a vigor for adventure and was kind and brave. However, as a young lady, she was sometims confused by the future. When I was singing,I felt the emotions floating with the melody and fairly enjoyed this experience. Also,during the proccess, I gradually learnt to analyse the character.</p>

<h3 id="The-Last-Leave"><a href="#The-Last-Leave" class="headerlink" title="The Last Leave"></a><em>The Last Leave</em></h3><p>When I was in junior high, I became keen on learning English. After participating in several English competitions and accumulating the experience of public speaking, I was recommended to join an English speaking competition in the 9th grade, representing  Jiangbei New Area. In the first section of  the competition I was supposed to put on a play with two 8th graders from our region.</p>
<p>This proccess was so unique and memorable not only because the outbreak of the virus forced us to meet online for most time, but also because I was able to be the script writer as well as the actress of Sue in our play. During this process, I studied the original novel written by O. Henry from aspects like the social background, the personalities of characters, the theme, the clothes of that era. Since we had to finish all the things by ourselves, we  learnt a lot about background design and how to add proper music at proper time. I even chose the costume myself. </p>
<p>What was special about this drama was that I learnt to be a leader of a team during the same time. Comunicating with my teammates Wang and Jin as well as their parents and teachers made me more experienced and contributed to my confidence greatly. Also, while rehearsing I lernt a lot about acting from Wang, who was a great actress.</p>
<p>All of these things made a big difference to my acting skills. When I was finally on stage, sorrow,hope and the feeling of struggling just flowed into my heart, natural and real, like a river. It was the first time I felt as if I was the character herself.<img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片1.png" alt="图片1"><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片2.png" alt="图片2"><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\图片3.png" alt="图片3"></p>

<h2 id="Senior-high–-dicovering-the-immense-ocean"><a href="#Senior-high–-dicovering-the-immense-ocean" class="headerlink" title="Senior high– dicovering the immense ocean"></a>Senior high– dicovering the immense ocean</h2><h3 id="Macbeth"><a href="#Macbeth" class="headerlink" title="Macbeth"></a>Macbeth</h3><p>When I entered Nanjing Foreign Language school, I chose drama as my selective course. It turned out to be the best choice I have ever made. Our drama class was amazing.</p>
<p>The first play we put on was Macbeth. In this play I acted as one of the witches. This task was quite challenging as well as rewarding. The witch was quite complicated to me. She was controlling everything from the beginning to the end and watched  and pushed Macbeth toward his tragic fate. However, what attracted me was what kind of feelings she had while she was driving Macbeth to commit one crime and another. Was she an indifferent bystander? Was she an active watcher ? Was she just a spokeswoman of fate? These questions were confusing so I asked my teacher for help. She told me that something great about drama was that you could always act the character in the way you understand and there was just no easy answer.</p>
<p>So in my version of the witch, she was just a spokeswoman of fate. She did not mean to be evil and did not enjoy the proccess of bringing Macbeth to the darkness but she was unable to change people’s destiny. Most people thought it was the witch that turned Macbeth a tragedy but from my point of view, it’s lady Macbeth and Macbeth himself  as well as the people around them that made his fate unavoidable. The witch was only a medium of indicating the darkness of humanity to th audience. This experience was quite interesting for it reminded me that characters could be complicated and we should spare no effort to find the cause of their actions.<img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材\Screenshot_2023-04-30-22-31-54-734-edit_com.tence.jpg" alt="Screenshot_2023-04-30-22-31-54-734-edit_com.tence"></p>

<h3 id="dubbing-Fantine-in-Les-Misrables"><a href="#dubbing-Fantine-in-Les-Misrables" class="headerlink" title="dubbing Fantine in Les Misrables"></a>dubbing Fantine in Les Misrables</h3><p>Our class put on this play on the foreign language festival.Compared with other experiences, this experience was very warm and meaningful.</p>
<p>When I was in junior high, I used to be afraid of singing in public. When I was singing for Fantine, however, my classmates kept encouraging me and gradually when I was singing what I felt was no longer embarrasement but the love  pain as well as a sense of helpless and hopeless of Fantine. While singing the esemble with my classmate, I taught her how to sing bel canto, the moment she improved her voice, I was more than happy.</p>
<p>While acting, I felt the passion of our class was in the air. Though we missed the first place because the category of our play was controversial, all the students and teachers were greatly shocked by our play. One of my classmate put our video online and it received over2000 views.</p>
<p><img src="D:\钰珠\留学英国\TP\输出\素材-6e4b9ee780633014.jpg" alt="-6e4b9ee780633014"></p>
<h3 id="The-Glass-Menagerie"><a href="#The-Glass-Menagerie" class="headerlink" title="The Glass Menagerie"></a>The Glass Menagerie</h3><p>It was a recent play our drama class is focusing on.</p>
<p>I played Laura and gradually found the masterpiece fascinating to me. Unlike the plays above, I was in awe of the use of poetic realism in this script. The music,the background,the plot…everything are arranged in such a transparent and splendid order to emphasis the tragedy of the gorgeous unrealistic world in which the Wingfields live.</p>
<p>Still I have substaintial questions to ask. I am curious whether Laura will be brave again(I hope but the possibility is low)I am curios whether the family will reunion eventually.When Laura passes the broken unicorn to Jim, does that suggests that she is greatly harmed or the knot in her heart is finnaly solved and she can live normally again?</p>

<p>I am still working on these problems and may have far to go. But what makes drama so attractive is that it’s like an  immense ocean and I still have a lot to discover.</p>
